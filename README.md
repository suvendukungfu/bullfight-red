# zipfs law used in bhagvad gita dataset
In Zipf’s Law analysis of Bhagavad Gita:

The number of shlokas per chapter, when plotted against the chapter’s rank on a log-log graph, approximately follows a linear decreasing trend.

This suggests that the distribution of shlokas across chapters shows a power law behavior similar to what Zipf’s Law predicts.

Although minor deviations are present (due to the philosophical structure of Gita), overall the trend supports Zipf’s principle: few chapters have many shlokas, many chapters have fewer shlokas.

Hence, the shloka distribution in Bhagavad Gita partially obeys Zipf’s Law.

Zipf's Law says: When you plot frequency vs rank on log-log scales, real-world data often forms a straight line (or close to it).

Your graph almost follows a downward straight curve ➔ meaning Bhagavad Gita’s chapter shlokas roughly follow Zipf's Law.

| Part                          | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High point at left**        | The first ranked chapter (most shlokas) has the highest value (around 78 shlokas).                                                                                                        |
| **Gradual decrease**          | As the rank increases, the number of shlokas decreases.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Logarithmic behavior**      | Both axes are in log scale, that's why straight-looking curves form even though real values vary non-linearly.                                                                            |
| **Non-perfect straight line** | Some "jumps" and "drops" are visible — this is **normal**, because religious texts aren’t purely random or man-made datasets. Still, overall trend is visible.                            |
| **Interpretation**            | Bhagavad Gita chapters are organized such that a few chapters have many shlokas and most have fewer — this behavior **matches Zipf’s Law** found in natural languages, books, music, etc. |
